<Heading>TEMPORARY</Heading>

- broken arm / finger 🏥
- eyes dilated 👁
- lost glasses 👓
- ruptured eardrum 👂

```notes
Further, we've all likely experienced a situation that made us temporarily disabled in one way or another
Talk about my broken toe, how I was unable to drive (manual transmission), had trouble getting up the steps to my apartment without help, etc.
Eyes dilated is another example
```

<Heading>SITUATIONAL</Heading>

- glaring sunlight 🌞
- noisy bar 🍻
- mother holding baby 🍼

```notes
If we haven't been temporarily disabled, we've definitely experienced a situation that inihibited our normal ability
  - think driving nito the sun, you may as well be blind
  - in a loud bar, may as well be deaf if someone is trying to talk to you.

<Heading>At least 15% of the world population has a disability</Heading>

```notes
For America, those numbers are more difficult to find up-to-date information.

The most recent numbers are the 2012 census, where it was found that roughly
  - 18% of Americans have a disability,
  - 12% of Americans identify their disability as severe.

  So why do we skip a11y so much? 😱
</Heading>

```notes
Reasons we often skip accessibility

Rarely is the reason because we actually dislike disabled people.

If we went around the room and asked everyone if they hate blind people or people with
autism my guess is most (hopefully all) of you would say, "No, they're people too and deserve to be treated as such!"

Time
Awareness
Don't know where to start

<Heading size="xl">prop-types</Heading>

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Image = ({ src, alt }) => <img src={src} alt={alt} />;

Image.propTypes = {
  src: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  alt: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

export default Image;
```

```notes
It's a lot easier to make 1 component accessible than it is to make an entire website accessible.
This helps curb the feeling that a11y is a daunting task that's too big to even start.
