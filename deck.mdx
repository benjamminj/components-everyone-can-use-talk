```notes
xkcd comic!
talk about that we're already familiar with the concept of accessibility
Braille, ramps at businesses etc.
```

```notes
Further, we've all likely experienced a situation that made us temporarily disabled in one way or another
Talk about my broken toe, how I was unable to drive (manual transmission), had trouble getting up the steps to my apartment without help, etc.
Eyes dilated is another example
```

---

```notes
If we haven't been temporarily disabled, we've definitely experienced a situation that inihibited our normal ability
  - think driving nito the sun, you may as well be blind
  - in a loud bar, may as well be deaf if someone is trying to talk to you.
```

Now take those physical disabilities and imagine how they would impact someone's ability to use your website!

```notes
Reasons we often skip accessibility

1. Time
2. Awareness
3. Don't know where to start
4. Actual disregard for people with disabilities
```

---

```notes
Actual disregard is rarely the reason we skip accessibility

This is the equivalent of saying "Blind people won't ever use our app"

I'd bet that if you go out in the street and ask random people, "Do you hate blind people?", you're gonna have a difficult time finding someone that answers "yes".

Most of us accept that people with disabilities are still human! And that they shouldn't be discriminated against or excluded from our websites
```

```notes
Time

a11y isn't an edge case to be skipped!

Use census data to prove that there's a lot of disabled people using the web if the examples before haven't brought the point home
```

---

```notes
Awareness
I'd encourage you to practice some empathy and try laying aside a little bit of your ability for a tiny bit.

Try to use your website without a mouse or turn on a screen reader, turn down the brightness on your monitor, and see what happens.

Chances are you'll walk out with an entirely new perspective on what it's like for someone with a disability to use your website...and some new tickets to add to your backlog.

```notes
Where to start

The component is the first line of defense against inaccessible interfaces
It's impossible to have an accessible interface if your components aren't accessible.
```

---

```notes
Where to start (cont.)

So how do we help our components become more accessible?

---
Learn how to test for accessibility. This means learning how to use a screen reader or trying to tab through your component while you're developing it. This will help you realize the edge cases that you need to be on the lookout for.
---
Start with a single point of failure. Rather than trying to tackle _all_ accessibility problems all at once, take one type of accessibility and try to fix that.

---
Bake it into your components' API. `prop-types` is extremely useful for enforcing certain required attributes on your components. For example, it's best practice that all `<img />` tags have an `alt` attribute or that buttons include a `type` attibute (because it will default to form submission). You can easily make sure that any inaccessible usage of the component throws development errors by making those props `required` on your `<Button />` and `<Image />` components.
---
Set up automated lint checks. There's some great tools out there to make sure that your components are automatically checked for common accessibility errors. For example, eslint with `react/jsx-a11y` with yell at you about a lot of common accessibility errors. If you want something more comprehensive, you can also set up tools like `axe-core`, `jest-axe`, or even `lighthouse` to run against your app in unit, integration, and end-to-end testing scenarios. These are super helful since they'll catch tons of errors that you might not initially notice or think to test for.
